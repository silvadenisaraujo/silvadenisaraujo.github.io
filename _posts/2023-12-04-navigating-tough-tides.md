# We don't have much control

If you have been part of a start-up for the past years, you know that the market conditions aren't promising, lay-offs happening here and there, and some say that the amount of job postings is decreasing, the reality is that there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, leading some workplaces to struggle and the worst, making people struggle with their situation. Sometimes they are in the same place for a long time and are scared to be laid off, sometimes they have just joined the organisation and are questioning themselves if they made the right choice or not.

According to [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), accessed on Dec 4th 2023, there were at least 1141 tech companies with layoffs impacting an estimated total of at least 250 thousand people.

Then you may see yourself in a position where you don't have much control and if you're leading a team people will make questions that you won't have the answer to as well, so you will need to be able to navigate all the uncertainty and challenges that may pop during this journey and the most important to support your colleagues during this process.

In this article, I will cover a strategy that I successfully used to ensure that our team is navigating the tough sea together, without dreading and most importantly supporting each other and using the opportunity to create a deeper team connection.

# Stinky Fish

![Stinky Fish Example](/assets/images/stinky-fishes.png)

Do you know when you leave something in your fridge and never touch it, even though you know that it is rotten already, you just don't want to deal with that at the moment, so you keep postponing throwing it in the trash as much as you can? Well, you know that the problem won't solve itself so you need to **act**.

> We do this quite often ourselves not only with things in our fridge, but also with our feelings!

## Psychological safety is a MUST

This moment is vulnerable, so if you as a leader don't have created a safe environment you won't be able to extract the real value from this exercise, because people will be afraid of telling the truth and being punished for it. So be cautious, and think twice if you think this is the correct moment if you're inviting the correct people. Ensure that you have people who trust each other and are there to support each other in dealing with their stinky fish.

## How to do it?

As said in the Hyper Island Toolbox, **the purpose is to create openness and "clear the air" within a group**. So ensure that you have scheduled proper time with everybody, some people may take longer to describe their feelings and we don't want to rush anybody here! If we are going to dig deep into our concerns this will take time.

Open the session with a clear statement of the seriousness of the exercise, and clearly stating that we are not here to judge nobody and we keep this session as light as possible, but we will discuss hard topics.

Actively Listen to everybody, I think it's important to say but never multi-task when talking with the team, we need to be there for them.

## The activity itself

[Here](https://toolbox.hyperisland.com/stinky-fish-13d9ce8d-e64f-4085-8a06-8d212c627788) you can find the exercise explanation by Hyper Island, and if you're a Miro user, here is a template that you can quickly set the session, but I will go over the details of how I did the exercise:

1. Each person will have their stinky fish, if you're in the middle of really creative and artistic folks, you can also suggest they draw their stinky fish or you can just use a template.

2. Set a timer, take 10 minutes for everybody to think about their concerns and write them down.

3. Each person will have a moment to go over their concerns, don't pick anybody at the start, let the team decide who is ready to start and they will follow.

4. While each person is explaining their fish, listen and make clarification questions, **DON'T INTERROGATE!**

5. Open the space for the team to discuss broadly without any structure for a few minutes.

6. Prepare yourself to give your view on the situation and do it with a clear message to the team.

7. Close the session with a Positive Check-out moment to share some love in the team, for example with a [Love Bomb of appreciation](https://toolbox.hyperisland.com/feedback-i-appreciate)!

# Reflection

I was a bit unsure about what would be the outcome of running this exercise in my team, but I gratefully closed the session with lots of appreciation and feedback to work with other leaders. This showed me that my team today feels SAFE inside the team, so thanks a lot for all of our work Data Platform team!

The most important part is to enable everybody to speak up about their concerns and to show the team that they are not alone. Doing such exercises not only helped the team to clear the air and to enable us to move on, but also helped us to create a stronger bond, so really show that we're there to enable them to be their best version, and sometimes 30% of we can do is our best.

I hope this article inspired you to go deep into the Stinky Fish and apply it in your scenario, I'm always open to meeting new people so feel free to reach out and we can go into more details and questions.
