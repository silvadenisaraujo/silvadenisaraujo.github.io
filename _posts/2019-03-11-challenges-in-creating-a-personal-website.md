### Have you ever tought how hard it is to build a personal website for you ?

During the past weeks I have been working on my online presence to show a little bit more about my work, skills and also to *engage more with the software development communities*.

So I looked in the internet for some good portfolios in Medium and so on and everytime that I looked for a portfolio I saw some amazing effects,  colorful, stunning design portfolios and I tought how could I do something for me that would be simpler ?

By the way, I'm a engineer and love how the bits and bytes works but unfortunatelly I don't have the gift of doing some beautiful designs!

And then, during my readings I reached to this article in Medium that helped a lot, so I recommend you to read: [A Software Engineerâ€™s One-Page Portfolio by Chuck Groom](https://medium.com/@cgroom/a-software-engineers-one-page-portfolio-4f85ab8a20d1)

So if design is a real challenge and you want to improve the time that you take to do it for you, I would do the same sugestion that I friend of mine did to me, Jekyll!

![Jekyll Logo](../assets/images/jekyll-logo-light-solid.png)

> Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

Better than that you can fork multiple portfolio themes from  or if you liked the one that I used, go ahed and [fork it!](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). And then easily you can start working on your posts as all of them are structured as markdown files.

So if you're thinking not only about working with freelance but also to improve your online presence take a look at this [Udacity Freelance Toolkit](https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/udacity-freelance-toolkit) that aggregates a lot of useful resources and if you have time read there's a booked called [Brag! Tooting your horn without blowing it](https://www.amazon.com/Brag-Tooting-Your-without-Blowing-ebook/dp/B001J2UVA2) that will give you some advices on how to work on your self-branding with balance.
