description: My thoughts on the ending process on charger cables
---

I think is well known the latest, a quite old, news that Apple stopped shipping together with new iPhones, their chargers! So currently inside the box, it has an iPhone and a USB-cable. When I was watching the moment of the news on the TV my first feeling was anger, "Really Apple ? Environment or profit ?", "you are already known for not making the best cables in the market and now you will say that you’re saving the environment with fewer chargers and the same price ?"

Well, that was just my rant, quite empty right? So let’s frame it more thoughtfully.

Some days after I had the opportunity to join a talk from [Joe Macleod](http://www.andend.co/) at Hyper Island about Ends and you can check the slides [here](https://www.slideshare.net/JosephMacleod/hyper-island-238712244)!

And for the very first moment, someone easily connected the dots in my mind regarding off-boarding experiences, and why there are some services that I always cancel and subscribe again but others that were so painful to off-board that I will never join back!

After the presentation, it made me look into deeper information on the Ends book, that I recommend. I would like to quote from the Business Oversight chapter regarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

> There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that for a company to engage in a CRS will have a positive impact on the business, not only on the public perception of its brand…

So yes Apple, makes total sense your goal of neutralizing your carbon footprint until 2030, go for it, and please take other companies with you, and there is a couple of really amazing initiatives [here](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/).

**However, damaging the environment isn’t done by business alone.**

What needs to be acknowledge is that very often business is operating on behalf of the consumer.

So Apple and other companies do their products and take their decision based on us, consumers! We demand more and more new features, gadgets, and hardware this is what they will provide. So as said by Joe in the book:

> We need to change this and recognize the responsibility of consumers -and, indeed, ourselves since we are all consumers. … this needs to be done by the creation of active off-boarding experience.

So Yes, I was wrong in my feeling, in the beginning, Apple is doing something that I’m not! So instead of pushing, as a customer, for some good off-boarding experiences on returning broken cables and spare parts, I’m just storing them in a drawer somewhere in my wardrobe.

The clear conclusion is that we need to start applying more energy to our product off-boarding experience to make it meaningful in the same way that we do on on-boarding.

And don’t think this only applies to products.
As an example yesterday my wife stopped a series of coaching sessions that she was doing with a friend and the first moment that she closed the experience, she told me: "It was horrible!", then I asked: "Would you go back in the future?" then she answered: "Definitely No!"

> So this basically defines that off-boarding is definitely as much as important than onboarding experience.

Thinking out loud, imagine then instead of a announcement that there will be no more chargers in the package, but that it would be optional with an extra cost and a store collection program would be in-place, so if you have a cable that doesn’t fit to the current input you could return them so Apple could give a proper ending to it and replace with a new one for minimal cost.

What would be the customer impact ? We will never know.

It’s time to act! Open your drawer with a ton of USB cables and chargers and start to think about what you’re going to do with all of them?

Or even take a step back, how is the off-boarding experience of the product or service that you are working on? There is a LOT of opportunities there.

Apple is thinking about the environment and you? **So let’s take back our environment responsibility from companies because we must drive this need for good off-boarding experiences, we must do it for our environment.**
