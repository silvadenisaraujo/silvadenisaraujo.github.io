description: My take after the first usage of Github Co-pilot
---

In the previous weeks, I have been accepted as a beta tester for Github Co-pilot, and here I am to give you my take on it and how I think this will impact what we know about the developer role today.

---

My story with coding started 14 years ago with Turbo Pascal, coding simple things like tic-tac-toe, calculators, and other tutorials I could find. Then it was when I got amazed that I have found a way to represent my ideas.

Following next, new languages came in, new paradigms, I actually got into it for many hours of my days and made it my profession. Since then I have never seen something so disrupting as the Github Co-Pilot!

Sometimes people ask me to explain how do I write code, how does the thought process works, if I know all commands and other things.

Well, definitely I don’t know everything about a single programming language, image for more than one! But it is surprising to people that coding is just a long process of doing, re-doing, giving up, and taking it back, just like art. Like any profession, it demands a lot of resilience.

## Getting out of the void

A blank project, an empty file, the first commit, comes with a lot of uncertainty and my solution to this is to simply write something! Getting out of the zero as soon as possible makes me think clearly, as the real problems will show up in the way, and then I feel free to edit and delete as much code as I can. In moments like this a co-pilot is all you need, may it be a colleague or an AI.

To evaluate these tools I started an empty project, I decided to create an OpenAI Gym Environment for Uno because definitely, my wife is better than me so why not develop some reinforcement learning bot that I can use to play against her.

Before I have only used the existing environments at OpenAi Gym, so it was a new thing to me, and the speed and joy that it takes to build something from scratch are amazing, you move faster when you bring co-pilot knowledge from an already developed environment to yourself.

## Learning new things

When you only have a hammer, everything becomes a nail. Learning new programming paradigms and languages are important steps in a career of a developer, basically increasing your toolbox that with time will enable you to use these tools better and find the right use-case for each one. Leaving here my disbelief in specific programming certifications.

Currently, I’m learning a little bit about Flutter, so I decided to start a new project using the co-pilot and it is incredible how it can support you in a learning journey, it reduces the time in reading a lot of details of a convoluted documentation.

## Co-Pilot in Action

Co-pilot has two simple ways to operate, it can be used as a super auto-complete, which not only gives us one option but at least three in the scenarios that I tested. Then, you can select the one that best fits. Or it can be used as a pure code generator, you write what you want, and ta-da the method is there.

## Will developers one day be substituted by AI?

In my thoughts, I don’t think so, I can be extremely wrong in the near future but I see that there will be shifts on what a developer should know. Knowing about infrastructure and math still being the basics of any coding skill. The more you know about how actually a device works, the best your code will be, but I don’t think that we will need to keep spending our times to develop many boilerplate that is necessary nowadays, and this is what we must strive for, to develop paradigms that enable us to focus on what matters. Many code repos that I have worked on are full of boilerplates and just a few parts that are the core of it all.

For sure machine learning and artificial intelligence should be in any software developer learning path, it is what will unlock the few next disruptive technology advances.

Co-pilot is the first step on moving into an era that developers will get support to be more efficient and have a more joyful experience. I study burnout and got struck about a comment in the discussion on co-pilot that a developer was talking about how much the stress level decreased for using the co-pilot and the time saved for looking for some basic questions that we google for it like printing dates in a specific format if you don’t do it frequently definitely you will query for it and will end up in a StackOverflow post that will help you, but there is also an important facet we must consider when using something like this.

During university I have learned things at the lowest level possible, like using oscilloscopes to calculate voltage and current, learning the instructions from a Motorola 6800, developed in 1974 and it was in 2012! The most important thing underlying any skills is to learn how things actually work. I think the Github Co-pilot is definitely amazing, but if you are learning a new programming language or even if you are learning how to code, you must be aware to take your time to review what actually is happening and understand the underlying nuances. This is what makes a good programmer, knowing actually what happens under the hood.

Coding fast won’t make your code better, coding more probably, but understanding the underlying things definitely will, understanding how compilers, processors, and memory works are important. Disruption is enabling a technology that already exists to the masses, now we need to see how the Co-Pilot will behave on the hype cycle, currently, there is a lot of expectation with this beta version, let's see how much inflated it is!

See you around and let’s keep coding.
