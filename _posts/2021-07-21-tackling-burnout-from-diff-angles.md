Nice! You just did a simple self-care exercise that might increase your attention and reflection on the next lines, thanks!

In the previous article, I have discussed a bit on what is burnout. So the question that comes next is, how to tackle it? or even better how to prevent it to happen?

We can see burnout as a wicked problem, there is no right or wrong, each one has its own experience, so in this article, we will take a view on tackling burnout from three different angles, and then we can reflect on what we can take from us?

## Personal View

There are many aspects on a personal level that needs consideration to deal with burnout. Bianca (Gafanhão 2021) shared that the person’s history and the meaning of work are essential topics. When there is a strong correlation between work and life and the values are not aligned things can do awry.

"Work dignifies the man," can lead to a perception that you never need to take a break and reconsider, otherwise you would not be dignified.

![Inflation rate in Brazil since 1980](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*ZesQK5Fh5I3SjSuZnYFJdA.png)

I have been raised in a middle-class Brazilian family and my parents have started their careers and family when Brazil was facing peaks of inflation with constant changes and new currencies coming in every time. This affects directly the meaning of work, and then I have inherited much of this concept of work and took me some time to realize it and the context of work has changed a lot, mainly how we do work. At the moment that I took the time to reflect on what work means to me, I could see my career from a different perspective, leaving some stress out of it.

> When there is a belief that "when you do what you love you are never working," so "who needs a day of when you are never working?" (Moss 2019).

In the same way that there are unique factors that lead to burnout, there is also a unique way to recover (Yu Tse Heng 2021). There is a common sense and research that engaging in self-care activities (such as a 10-minute meditation session, cooking a nice meal, or even taking a nap) correlated strongly with reduced levels of reported burnout the following day. These findings support the notion that self-care is not self-indulgent; on the contrary, taking a break and focusing on the self is one of the best ways to combat exhaustion and burnout.

According to (Maslach 2017), health, fitness, relaxation, self-understanding, emotional regulation, changes in work structure, and social support are essential to be analyzed and further studied. However, to remember you I’m not a psychologist if you are feeling that you are lifting some heavyweights every working day, I recommend to you to speak to a psychologist that will help you, maybe the feeling that you have is caused by other reasons that will need professional support.

So this was looking to ourselves and the environment how we can tackle it?

## Organizational View

Currently, organizations often neglect their role in fixing it, can be for unfamiliarity or denial, and as burnout has been a focus of the psychology field that it developed as a person-centered “mental illness” problem where the organization is not responsible (Maslach 2017).

The role of an organization regarding burnout is to remove the stigmatized view on it, where burnout is a sign of weakness and incompetence (ibid.).

![Google Project Aristotle Outcome](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*Qtpnaw7TCDXcrbfe)

Organizations that provide purposeful work deliver and plan projects based on a solid common sense of purpose aligned between leaders tend to decrease burnout levels drastically (Moss 2021). So how an organization makes the work happen has a direct impact on how people feel, when there is a sense of autonomy, belongingness, competence, psychological safety, positive emotions, fairness, meaning (Maslach 2017), there is a direct impact on teams effectiveness and people feelings with work.

[Google’s Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/) raised the importance of psychological safety and is a reading that I definitely recommend.

And when we talk about the organization perspective there is another key person on the process that is your direct manager, How you as a direct manager or teammate can help to support a healthier environment.

## Leadership View

Inside an organization, ineffective managers become the cause of burnout rather than its cure (Wigert 2020). Direct managers are the ones that possess more tools and proximity to tackle burnout in a team. To do so, Kelly Greenwood and Natasha Krol (Kelly Greenwood 2020) have identified eight ways where managers can support mental health:

- Be vulnerable: Being honest about mental health, opening the doors for a colleague to come and talk about their perspective and challenges in the topic.

- Model healthy behaviors: Not only talking about burnout, but it also is important to lead by example and set own boundaries, and take care of own mental health.

- Culture of "Check-ins": "How are you?" is often a sub utilized question, as often the first response if not exactly what we mean (ibid.). Developing further check-in questions in a purposeful, thoughtful, and intentional manner increases the likelihood of being powerful (Hyper Island 2021). In addition, it emphasized presence, focus, and commitment. Hyper Island has a tool for check-in that we use regularly in our meetings that helps us to tune ourselves with others and generate a safer space.

- Flexibility and Inclusion: Do not make assumptions about the needs of direct reports. They may be going over a transition phase in their lives. Sometimes, there is a need for more considerable flexibility than regular; for example, during the pandemics, the mix of homeschooling and work has forced parents to juggle the same day period for multiple tasks. At the same time, they would benefit from working in different periods. Asking and having open conversations is essential to understand each employee’s moment in their life.

- Communicate more than it should: During the pandemic, there was a more significant concern of job security than ever before (Blind 2020), so communicating any organizational change is vital to everybody to feel included, also it is essential to frame issues around the positive end of the continuum, this enables more effective conversation regarding the burnout problem (Maslach 2017). It is crucial to define a communication framework with the team to avoid the increase of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and reduce the always-on culture (Thomas 2020).

- Invest in training: One of the main attributes of burnout is depersonalization. Understanding and keeping in contact with the self are essential to reflect on issues that we face every day. Investing in training is vital to spread the knowledge and enable each one to reflect on themselves.

- Modify Policies: We are facing times never lived before. For example, the intense move to work from home and the ”Zoom-marathon” that we all face were not part of our lives when many company policies were defined. Review them and evaluate what still makes sense. Moreover, it is essential to highlight this change’s relevance to improving mental health when communicating changes.

- Measure: Get direct feedback from employees, share surveys and make use of burnout measurement tools to evaluate the team levels of stress, or instead of measuring the stress, it is possible to use tools to measure happiness and use its inverse value also as an indicator. We will cover many tools on how burnout can be measure, and this is the primary goal of this article: to evaluate a machine learning model to forecast burnout levels.

## Reflection

At the moment that I read and reflect on all this information, I see that it is key to me to define clear boundaries, between what is work and what is not, what is health and what is not, and so on. Having clear boundaries and communicate them make us free from misperception.

Mental healthcare should be part of any organization's agenda, as it plays a big role in productivity and in the end profit. Developing effective teams depends on building a safe environment where each person can be themselves, being diverse, inclusive, and vulnerable are characteristics that unlock people’s potential, so if you run an organization, how could you implement it? And as a team player how do you foment this vulnerability? Do you help people to be themselves? When people are being stretched for too long they will spend more energy than recover it.

I hope that know you have taken some time to reflect on your own thoughts about burnout and what you could do about it. The next piece of this puzzle is, how do we measure burnout? If I question that burnout could be predicted, the first thing is, could burnout be measured?

See you down the road.
