<p>I was born in a city called Poá near to São Paulo in 1992. And from what I remember I was always passionated with sports, games and building stuff, most of time destroying some :) . I remember that the first time that I had contact with a computer was when I was 8 years old and I went to one of my mom's typing class and at that time I did my first paint drawing and got completed amazed with all I could do with a computer!</p>

<p> That's how my life with computers started. After some time I did a lot of courses in a small school near my parent's house in HTML, Dreamweaver and Pascal! During high school I did a technical course on information technology and loved each part of it that in the end I was awarded as the best student in class. In the next year I've got accepted at the Federal University of Itajubá for Computer Engineering and that has been one of my favorite periods of my life where I could learn everyday what was the meaning of engineering.</p>

<p>During graduation I always did more than expected, so I've done two scientific projects in Software Engineering and Optical Fibers and I still have this with me, the passion of keep learning! <b>And then if you mix all of my experiences, a litle bit from my parents, my wife, my friends and my dogs you will know exactly who am I.</b></p>

<p>My favorite quote is: <u>"Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. - <i>Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)</i>"</u> Because I truly believe it and unfortunatelly I could see it.</p>
